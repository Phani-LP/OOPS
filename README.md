# OOPS

## Class: 
A class is blue print. It have methods, attributes, constructor function, etc.,
## Object:
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class, with its own unique data attributes and, potentially, modified behavior through its methods.

## Attributes: 
Also known as properties or fields, attributes are the data members of a class that define the characteristics of an object.

## Methods: 
Methods are functions associated with a class. They define the behavior of the class and can operate on the data attributes of the object.
## Instance:
## Self: 
## Inheritance:
## Method Overloading: 
### Same method name but the difference is in the number of parameters or different datatypes of parameters or both is called "Method Overloading". 
We can't directly use method overloading in python. To use it we have to install "multipledispatch" package.
To use multipledispatch, you need to install the package first. You can do this using a package manager like pip:  pip install multipledispatch<br>
## Features of method overloading: 
Flexibility, Readability, Program Complexity decrease.
